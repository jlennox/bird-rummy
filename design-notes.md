- Behaviors of the specific species is attempted to be reflected in the cards mechanics.
- Avoid sending birds to Heaven. Dead birds make me sad.
    - Birds should leave a nest to go to the Forest or the other nest.
- Birds are wild animals. These are not the player's pets. They want to and should move between play areas frequently.
- Birds should move in and out of is the Forest with less restrictions than the discard pile in rummy.
- Never have the ability of looking at opponent's hand. A big aspect of rummy is secrecy.
- Considering having multiple cards for the same bird. IE, have 2 types of scrub jays, and the player can choice the abilities on any of the ones being played or in their nest.
- 60'ish card deck should provide for reasonable game length, not need to dig for duplicate birds for too long, and not over tax players memory.
- The games are intended to be casually competitive and not much longer than a normal rummy game, 10 - 15 minutes.
- "Cuckoo" is interesting.
    - Someone could have one in hand. The other person plays a pair and infects the other player. They then play their one and can pass them back.
    - Alternatively, they're high value, so perhaps pocket a pair until close to the end of the game, and do not pass them.
    - Perhaps a better mechanic could be to make them negative value?
- Keep a consistent writing tone and style.
    - Uh, what?
    - _Sometimes_ leverage what's common magic the gathering wording, to help onboard those players easier.
    - "Place", "Discard", and some others should all be consistently used, but not all words need a definition in the manual.
- Easier maths:
    - The value of cards should stay as consistent as possible, allowing users to count cards instead of doing maths.
    - Try and track to the number 10.
        - 5 is a nice number because it's often simpler to work with a 2 divisor of 10. "I have 12 cards at 5 value. 12 div 2 means I have 60 points."
